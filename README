Opti is a DSL and compiler to generate fast incremental C code from declarative specifications.

To build the ocaml code, do:

    cd ocaml/
    make

The opti main program can then be invoked as follows:

    ./opti_main.native -i opti_code.opti -o generated_c_code.c

There are emacs and vim modes for Opti that provide rudimentary syntax
highlighting.  For emacs installation instructions, see emacs/INSTALL.
For vim installation, just run bin/intall-vim-syntax
