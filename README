Opti is a DSL and compiler to generate fast incremental C code from declarative specifications.

To build the ocaml code, do:

    dune build @runtest @install

The opti main program can then be invoked as follows:

    opti -i opti_code.opti -o generated_c_code.c -h generated_c_code.h

There are emacs and vim modes for Opti that provide rudimentary syntax
highlighting. See the emacs/ and vim/ subdirectories respectively.
